## Introduction

SuperTuxKart is a 3D open-source arcade racer with a variety characters, tracks, and modes to play. SuperTuxKart's gameplay is similar to that of the Mario Kart series, but also has distinct elements, such as collecting and using cans of Nitro. The game features the mascots of several open source projects. The game supports single player, local multiplayer, WAN multiplayer, and LAN multiplayer modes.

You can race by yourself against the computer, compete in several Grand Prix cups, or try to beat your fastest time in Time Trial mode. You can also race or battle with up to eight friends on a single computer, play on a local network or play online with other players all over the world.
